# RawRefinery

**RawRefinery** is an open-source application for **raw image quality refinement and denoising**.

Currently in **alpha release**, RawRefinery provides a high-quality raw image denoising tool that works directly on most Bayer image formats, including those from **Canon, Nikon, and Sony** cameras.

## Overview

![RawRefinery main window](https://github.com/rymuelle/RawRefinery/blob/main/examples/RawRefinery.png)

RawRefinery lets you visually explore and refine your raw files through a simple, intuitive interface.
It uses a deep learning‚Äìbased denoising model designed to preserve fine image detail while removing noise, even at very high ISO values.

---

## Installation

Download the macOS build here:
[**RawRefinery v1.1.0-alpha**](https://github.com/rymuelle/RawRefinery/releases/tag/v1.1.0-alpha)

Windows and Linux versions are coming soon, along with setup instructions for building from source.

## üöÄ Usage

1. **First launch:**
   On first run, the app will download the denoising model (~500 MB).

2. **Selecting files:**
   Choose a directory containing your raw files. Selecting a file from the left panel displays:

   * A **thumbnail** (left)
   * A **100% preview** (right)

   Clicking on the thumbnail updates the preview region.

3. **Adjusting settings:**
   Two sliders are available below the preview:

   * **ISO conditioning:** Adjusts model sensitivity to match the image ISO. It defaults to the detected ISO but can be fine-tuned.
   * **Blend:** Mixes a portion of the original image back into the result to recover subtle high-frequency details.

   After changing either slider, click **‚ÄúPreview Denoise‚Äù** to re-render the preview.

4. **Saving results:**
   When satisfied, click **‚ÄúSave Denoised Image‚Äù** to export a denoised `.DNG`.
   Processing may take up to a minute and use several GB of memory (RAM or VRAM depending on the backend).
   Supported backends: **CUDA**, **MPS**, and **CPU**.

### Model Architecture and Training

The model training code is currently being documented and refactored here:

https://github.com/rymuelle/Restorer/tree/feature/mps

The feature/mps branch contains the base model architecture and the training code, however, it is a current work in progress. 

---

## Development Status

RawRefinery is currently in **pre-release alpha**, and testing is ongoing.
Bug reports and feedback on denoising performance are greatly appreciated.

### Current priorities:

1. Add Windows and Linux support
2. Integrate newer denoising models
3. Improve user experience ‚Äî progress bars, threading, and real-time responsiveness

Feature requests and community contributions are welcome!

---

### Feedback

If you encounter issues or have suggestions, please open an [issue](https://github.com/rymuelle/RawRefinery/issues) on GitHub.
You can also share before/after results or performance feedback to help guide model improvements.
